# liveSound
One stop encouragement for live music! 

## Summary

liveSound is built on Node.js, Express, MongoDB and the SeatGeek API. 

The SeatGeek API provided information about events based on geolocation, as well as results from intelligent searching (i.e. recommendation query responses). This app uses the geoid lookup for nearby events as well as recommended lookup based on past favorites and current taste. 

Developed for Carnegie Mellon University's 67-328: Mobile to Cloud: Distributed Apps Fall 2016.
